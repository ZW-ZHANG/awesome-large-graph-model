This repository contains a paper list related to **Large Graph Models** and **Graph Foundation Models**. Similar to Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural languages, we believe large graph models/graph foundation models will revolutionaize graph machine learning with exciting opportunities for both researchers and practioners! For more details, please refer to our perspective paper: [Graph Meets LLMs: Towards Large Graph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14522)

We will try our best to make this paper list updated. If you notice some related papers missing or have any suggestion, do not hesitate to contact us via pull requests at our repo.

Note: this project was initiated while I was a postdoc researcher at Tsinghua University. I have started my new career at Beihang University so my personal updates for this paper list will be released in this forked repo.
